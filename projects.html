                                technology concept where data from several agricultural fields ranging from small to large 
                                scale and its surrounding are collected using smart electronic sensors. The collected data are 
                                analyzed by experts and local farmers to draw short term and long term conclusion on weather 
                                pattern, soil fertility, current quality of crops, amount of water that will be required for next

                                This project consists of Arduino as brain and we are utilizing 5 sensors which measures six 
different environmental factors that crop’s growth and nourishment depend on:<br>1) Temperature and humidity sensor.<br>
2) Air Quality / gas sensor.<br>
3) Light sensor.<br>
4) Soil moisture sensor.<br>
5) Barometric pressure sensor.<br></a>

The word “vote” means to choose from a list, to elect or to determine. the main goal of voting is to come up with leader of the people choice. The online voting is based on SMS sending to voters, to confirmation of vote. this web based is very useful like time saving, work load reduced information available at time it provides security for the data. The proposed online voting system allows the voter to scan the finger print which is then matched with an already save image within database that is retrieved from adhaar card database of the government. This online system voting will avoid the process of physical touching or visiting places and also in pandemic time it is very helpful to conduct elections.<br>The existing manual Voting system consumes more time for Vote Casting. Voter has to wait for vote polling station to vote for a right candidate.<br><br>The objective of the system is a replacement of the traditional system that is in existence. This smart system reduces the time for voting and also the system is reliable, and faster.</a>
